Hubot adapter for http://fleep.io


# Project status

The adapter works, but only for really straightforward usage. A lot of corner cases are as of yet unhandled: what happens when the bot joins with a conversation with previous history? What happens if the bot is present in multiple channels? What happens...

Anyhow. Feel free to build upon it (send pull requests!) and use it, but please, don't do it in production. I *might* find enough motivation to finish it, but I won't give any deadlines.
